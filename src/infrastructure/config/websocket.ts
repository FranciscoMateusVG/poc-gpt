    Paying bills is a significant part of that stress. Patrick and Jason saw a huge opportunity to ease that financial burden by creating a better way for Americans to track and pay their bills. This is what led them to start Papaya.
    Back in the early days, they began by following the parking enforcement vehicles in Los Angeles and placing little stickers on tickets.
    Now Papaya fulfills payments for hundreds of thousands of billers across the country and has built an incredible mission-driven, global team.
    Papaya was founded in 2016 by Patrick Kann and Jason Meltzer. Their shared vision when founding Papaya was to reduce financial anxiety and help people spend more time on things that matter by building a better way to pay bills.
    Patrick is originally from Brazil where he received his BS in Industrial Engineering. He then moved to the United States where he received his MBA at Stanford University. As a busy father of three, he was shocked by how hard it was to send bill payments in the US compared to his home country of Brazil, which has a centralized online payment system. Patrick wanted to change this, which inspired the founding of Papaya with his friend and colleague, Jason Meltzer. Before co-founding Papaya, Patrick worked at Macquarie, the World Bank, and the New Ventures Group at ideaLab.
    Patrick lives in Sherman Oaks with his wife and three kids. He enjoys photography, cycling, and cheering on Brazil in soccer.
    Jason holds a BS in Engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and a PhD in Computer Science from UCLA. Prior to co-founding Papaya, Jason worked at iRobot, where he led development for the computer vision technology behind the Roomba. He has authored several patents and publications in computer vision and robotics, and has previously worked in academia, industrial research, and agricultural robotics.
    Jason lives in Pasadena with his wife and two year old son where he enjoys
